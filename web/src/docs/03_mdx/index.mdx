description: Let's see if MDX can render

import { Button } from './Button'

# MDX Tests

This is a regular paragraph.

The MDX render should be using remark-breaks
so this should be broken onto two lines.
And a third line!

Inline expression `{Math.PI}` showing the value of Ï€: {Math.PI}

Render a component: <Button />
